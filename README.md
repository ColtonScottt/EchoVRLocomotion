# EchoVRLocomotion
This is a locomotion system based off of the Echo VR Movement.

VERY IMPORTANT!!

If you want this to work with your Unity project, you need to set the projects *gravity* to zero, and make a XRRig properly.

To change the gravity, go to **Project Settings**, **Physics**, and then set the **Gravity** Vector3 to (0, 0, 0).

To make a proper XRRig, use the Unity XR plugin, and use XRNodes for the head, left, and right hands.

Have fun!
